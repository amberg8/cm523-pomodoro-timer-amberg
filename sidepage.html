<h1> About</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Pomodoro Timer website!  The Pomodoro Timer is a tool that can help you optimize your time and maximize your productivity.The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "Pomodoros," the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>
 <p> My Pomodoro Timer website offers a simple and easy-to-use timer that you can customize to fit your needs. You can set the length of your Pomodoros, as well as the duration of your breaks. You can also add your tasks to keep track of what needs to be done and what you have accomplished so far. The timer is designed to help you stay focused and motivated while you work. Happy Pomodoro-ing!
